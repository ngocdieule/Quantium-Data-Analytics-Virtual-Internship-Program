## 📂 Tasks & Deliverables  

### **Task 1 – Customer Analytics & Commercial Insights**

**Goal:** Understand chips category performance, identify key customer segments, and generate commercial recommendations.

**Key Analyses:**  
- **Seasonality:** Chips sales spike during Christmas → holiday promotions crucial.  
- **Customer Segmentation:**  
  - Top volume driver: **Budget – Older Families**  
  - Top spenders per purchase: **Mainstream – Young Singles/Couples**  
- **Willingness to Pay:**  
  - Mainstream customers spend more per purchase (statistically significant).  
- **Brand Affinity (Mainstream Young Singles/Couples):**  
  - **Over-indexed brands:** Doritos, Pringles, Kettle, Tyrrells, Twisties, Tostitos (+20–25%)  
  - **Under-indexed brands:** Smiths, Woolworths PL, Red Rock Deli, Natural Chip Co  
- **Pack Size Affinity:**  
  - Over-indexed: Large sharing packs (270g, 330g, 380g)  
  - Under-indexed: Very small or niche sizes (<125g, 180–220g, 300g)  

**Deliverable:**  
- **Executive summary + insights slides** with strategic implications:  
  - Focus Christmas campaigns to capture peak demand  
  - Target Mainstream Young Singles/Couples  
  - Partner with bold brands and emphasize large pack formats

### **Task 2 – Uplift Testing & Store Performance Analysis**

**Goal:** Evaluate impact of new trial store layout and recommend rollout strategy.

**Key Analyses:**  
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD):** Adjusted for pre-trial trends to isolate layout effect.  

| **Store** | **In-Trial vs Control** | **Pre-Trial Diff** | **DiD Effect** | **Interpretation** |
|----------|-----------------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **77** | +30.7% | +23.4% | **+7.3%** | ✅ Positive uplift, statistically significant |
| **86** | +14.1% | +16.1% | **–2.0%** | ⚠️ No real improvement after adjustment |
| **88** | –9.4% | –8.2% | **–1.3%** | ❌ Negative impact on sales |

**Key Drivers (Store 77):**  
- **Customer Growth:** +20.8% → largest contributor  
- **Basket Size:** +6.1% → extra units per customer  
- **Spend/Customer:** +1.66% → softer spend decline, shift to premium packs  
- **Transaction Frequency:** –2.0% → slightly fewer trips (small effect)  

**Deliverable:**  
- **Tabular results** + **interpretation narrative**  
- **Recommendation:** Selective rollout, prioritize stores like 77, avoid rollout in 86/88 without further testing

### **Task 3 – Stakeholder Communication**

**Goal:** Present findings to the Category Manager in a clear and actionable way.

**Deliverable:**  
- **Slide deck** including:  
  - Executive Summary of Tasks 1 & 2  
  - Visualizations (DiD results, uplift drivers)  
  - Strategic recommendations for marketing, product mix, and rollout
